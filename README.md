# proposal to change video codec filters for encoding raw video,

# protect-videos-to-know-origin-even-if-unknown

video filters with embedded transparent metadata of IP origin as a QR code or not as an embedded layer to uncover the source of video being transmitted illegally as a source of a privacy violation,
the possibility of image recognition technology to identify a person if they are present in video being transmitted as a privacy violation as part of the hidden layer of video encoded as part of the metadata 

# unknown source of video,

# unseen layer while the video is running (if this video example was a video broadcast not licensed or authroized by an entity to be transmitted)
